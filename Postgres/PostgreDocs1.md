## What is a Database ?

**Answer** : An organised collection of data.
A method to manipulate and access the data.

## Why Postgers is useful as excel does the same things ?

PostgreSQL is more useful than Excel for these key reasons:

1. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets (millions of rows) efficiently, unlike Excel.
2. **Data Integrity**: Enforces ACID compliance, ensuring reliable data management.
3. **Multi-user Support**: Allows concurrent access by many users with proper permissions.
4. **Complex Queries**: Supports advanced querying, joins, and data analysis.
5. **Automation and Integration**: Integrates with various systems and supports automated operations.

While Excel is great for simple, manual data tasks, PostgreSQL is better for large-scale, reliable, and automated data management.

### Organised Data

Organised data is always easy to access.


## Database vs DBMS

**DBMS (Database Management System)** is software that manages databases, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data. 

**Relation to Website/App:**
- A **DBMS** is used by websites/apps to interact with the **database** (where data is stored). The DBMS handles data storage, retrieval, and security for the application, while the **database** is the organized collection of data itself.

## What is RDBMS ?

A type of database system that stores data in structured tables (using rows and columns) and uses SQL for managing and querying data.

### Some Other Databases are:

- MongoDB
- Oracle
- MySQL
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- MaxDB
- Firebird
- Redis

## SQL vs PostgreSQL

### SQL

Structured Query Language which is used to talk to our databases.
`Example`: SELECT * FROM person_db;

**SQL** is a standardized language used for querying and managing databases. Itâ€™s used across various database systems.

**PostgreSQL** is a specific database management system (DBMS) that uses SQL, but also offers additional features like advanced data types, performance optimizations, and support for complex operations. 

In summary:
- **SQL** is the language.
- **PostgreSQL** is a DBMS that uses SQL, with extra capabilities and enhancements.
